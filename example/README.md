# Authentication Architecture Demo

This directory contains a simple demonstration of the refactored authentication architecture.

## Running the Demo

```bash
# From the go-user-management directory
go build -o simple_demo example/simple_demo.go
./simple_demo
```

## What the Demo Shows

The `simple_demo.go` file demonstrates:

1. **Authentication Provider Interface** - The core abstraction that enables pluggable authentication
2. **Provider Types** - Different authentication methods supported (password, OAuth, SAML, etc.)
3. **Password Hashing** - Secure credential storage using Argon2id
4. **Authentication Results** - Structured response from authentication operations
5. **Architecture Benefits** - How the design follows SOLID principles
6. **Extensibility** - How to add new authentication providers
7. **Migration Strategy** - How to transition from the old system

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is separate from user management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different authentication methods can be used interchangeably  
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New providers can be added without modifying existing code
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces for each concern
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are injected for testability

## Dependencies

The demo only uses:
- Go standard library
- `github.com/MichaelAJay/go-encrypter` (for secure password hashing)
- The refactored authentication modules

No external dependencies for logging, metrics, config, or cache are required for the demo.

## Next Steps

After running the demo, explore:
1. The authentication provider interface in `auth/provider.go`
2. The password provider implementation in `auth/providers/password/provider.go`
3. The authentication manager in `auth/manager.go`
4. The updated user entity in `user/user.go`
5. The refactored user service in `user/service.go`
